Each row in the dataset describes the properties of a single house as well as the amount it was sold for. In this course, we'll build models that predict the final sale price from its other attributes. Specifically, we'll explore the following questions:\n","\n","- Which properties of a house most affect the final sale price?\n","- How effectively can we predict the sale price from just its properties?\n","\n","This dataset was originally compiled by [Dean De Cock](http://www.truman.edu/faculty-staff/decock/) for the primary purpose of having a high quality dataset for regression. You can read more about his process and motivation [here](http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) and download the dataset [here](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.txt).\n","\n","Here are some of the columns:\n","\n","- **Lot Area**: Lot size in square feet.\n","- **Overall Qual**: Rates the overall material and finish of the house.\n","- **Overall Cond**: Rates the overall condition of the house.\n","- **Year Built**: Original construction date.\n","- **Low Qual Fin SF**: Low quality finished square feet (all floors).\n","- **Full Bath**: Full bathrooms above grade.\n","- **Fireplaces**: Number of fireplaces.\n","\n","Let's start by generating train and test datasets and getting more familiar with the data.\n","\n","**Exercise Start**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","\n","- Read **AmesHousing.txt** into a dataframe using the tab delimiter (**\\t**) and assign to **data**.\n","- Select the first **1460** rows from **data** and assign to **train**.\n","- Select the remaining rows from **data** and assign to **test**.\n","- Use the **dataframe.info()** method to display information about each column.\n","- Read the [data documentation](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt) to get more familiar with each column.\n","- Using the data documentation, determine which column is the target column we want to predict.

understanding the univariate case of linear regression, also known as **simple linear regression**. The following equation is the general form of the simple linear regression model.\n","\n","$$\\hat{y}=a_1x_1+a_0$$\n","\n","$\\hat{y}$ represents the target column while $x_1$ represents the feature column we choose to use in our model. These values are independent of the dataset. On the other hand, $a_0$ and $a_1$ represent the **parameter** values that are specific to the dataset. The goal of simple linear regression is to find the optimal parameter values that best describe the relationship between the feature column and the target column. The following diagram shows different simple linear regression models depending on the data:\n","\n","<img width=\"500\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1aYSv01fP3tEoEukxRmMZFcfJwZfzS-UV\">\n","\n","\n","The first step is to select the feature, $x_1$, we want to use in our model. Once we select this feature, we can use scikit-learn to determine the optimal parameter values $a_1$ and $a_0$ based on the training data. Because one of the assumptions of linear regression is that the relationship between the feature(s) and the target column is linear, we want to pick a feature that seems like it has the strongest correlation with the final sale price.\n","\n","**Exercise Start**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" alt=\"creating a repo\"

Each combination of unique parameter values forms a unique linear regression model, and the process of finding these optimal values is known as **model fitting**. Both approaches to model fitting we'll explore aim to minimize the following function:\n","\n","$$MSE=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\hat{y}_i−y_i)^2$$\n","\n","\n","This function is the mean squared error between the predicted labels made using a given model and the true labels.

If you recall, we computed the critical points by calculating the curve's derivative, setting it equal to 0, and finding the x value at this point. Unfortunately, this approach won't work when we have multiple parameter values because minimizing one parameter value may increase another parameter's value. In addition, while we can plot the MSE curve when we only have a single parameter we're trying to find and visually select the value that minimizes the MSE, this approach won't work when we have multiple parameter value because we can't visualize past 3 dimensions.\n","\n","In this mission, we'll explore an iterative technique for solving this problem, known as **gradient descent**. The [gradient descent algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) works by iteratively trying different parameter values until the model with the lowest mean squared error is found. Gradient descent is a commonly used optimization technique for other models as well, like neural networks, which we'll explore later in this track.\n","\n","Here's an overview of the gradient descent algorithm for a single parameter linear regression model:\n","\n","- select initial values for the parameter: $a_1$\n","- repeat until convergence (usually implemented with a max number of iterations):\n","    - calculate the error (MSE) of model that uses current parameter value: $MSE(a_1)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\\hat{y}^{(i)}−y^{(i)})^2$\n","    - calculate the derivative of the error (MSE) at the current parameter value: $\\frac{d}{da_1}MSE(a_1)$\n","    - update the parameter value by subtracting the derivative times a constant ($\\alpha$, called the learning rate): $a_1:=a_1−\\alpha \\frac{d}{da_1}MSE(a_1)$\n","    \n","    \n","In the last step of the algorithm, you'll notice we used we used := to indicate that the value on the right is assigned to the variable on the left. While in Python, we've used to the equals operator (=) for assignment, we've used it in math (=) to signify equality. For example, a = 1 in Python assigns the value 1 to the variable a. In math, a=1 asserts that a is equal to 1. In mathematical papers, sometimes $\\leftarrow$ is also used to signify assignment:\n","\n","$a_1\\leftarrow a_1 − \\alpha \\frac{d}{da_1}MSE(a_1)$\n","\n","Selecting an appropriate initial parameter and learning rate will reduce the number of iterations required to converge, and is part of hyperparameter optimization.

Linear regression operates under the assumption that the features are linearly correlated with the target column. For a categorical feature, however, there's no actual numerical meaning to the categorical codes that pandas assigned for that colum. An increase in the **Utilities** column from **1** to **2** has no correlation value with the target column, and the categorical codes are instead used for uniqueness and exclusivity (the category associated with **0** is different than the one associated with **1**).\n","\n","The common solution is to use a technique called [dummy coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_%28statistics%29).

Features\n","\n","In the last few sections, we focused on categorical values that were represented as text columns. Some of the numerical columns in the data set are also categorical and only have a limited set of unique values. We won't explicitly explore those columns in this mission, but the feature transformation process is the same if the numbers used in those categories have no numerical meaning.\n","\n","Let's now look at numerical features that aren't categorical, but whose numerical representation needs to be improved. We'll focus on the **Year Remod/Add** and **Year Built** columns:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> train[['Year Remod/Add', 'Year Built']]\n","0   1960    1960\n","1   1961    1961\n","2   1958    1958\n","3   1968    1968\n","4   1998    1997\n","...\n","```\n","\n","The two main issues with these features are:\n","\n","- Year values aren't representative of how old a house is\n","- The **Year Remod/Add** column doesn't actually provide useful information for a linear regression model\n","\n","\n","The challenge with year values like **1960** and **1961** is that they don't do a good job of capturing how old a house is. For example, a house that was built in **1960** but sold in **1980** was sold in half the time one built in **1960** and sold in **2000**. Instead of the years certain events happened, we want the difference between those years. We should create a new column that's the difference between both of these columns.\n","\n","For this particular piece of information (years until remodeled), this is a sensible approach. Domain knowledge can help you understand how to best transform features to represent information well for a linear model. If you're ever confused about a feature or how it should be represented, reading scientific papers or posts by researchers in the specific domain is critical.
